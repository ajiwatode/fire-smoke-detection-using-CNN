# fire-smoke-detection-using-CNN
This repository contains the code for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect fire and smoke in images. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and the web interface is implemented using Gradio. Additionally, it utilizes NumPy, Pandas, and OpenCV libraries for data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization.
