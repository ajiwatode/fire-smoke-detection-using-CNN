# fire-smoke-detection-using-CNN
This repository contains the code for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect fire and smoke in images. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras, and the web interface is implemented using Gradio. Additionally, it utilizes NumPy, Pandas, and OpenCV libraries for data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization.


Fire and smoke detection is crucial for early warning systems in various environments, including residential, industrial, and natural landscapes. This project aims to develop a CNN model capable of accurately detecting fire and smoke in images, facilitating prompt response and mitigation measures.
